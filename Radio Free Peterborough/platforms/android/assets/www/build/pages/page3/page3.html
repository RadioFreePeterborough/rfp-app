<h2>About the Radio <br/>Free Peterborough Project</h2>
</ion-card-header>
<ion-card-content>
<p>
	Radio Free Peterborough was founded in the summer of 2004 as the answer to the question "I wonder how much Peterborough music you could get together in 
	one place?"
</p>
<p>
	In partnership with Trent Radio, the Radio Free Peterborough / Local Content Archive has grown quite a lot from our humble beginnings!  We run on 100% volunteer power with an operating budget of $0, using 100% Open Source Software.  We did it - so can you! 
</p>
<p>
	Listen to Radio Free Peterborough with this app, online via our website at 
	<a href="http://www.radiofreepeterborough.ca">http://radiofreepeterborough.ca</a> 
	or all night every night on Trent Radio 92.7 FM in Peterborough and surrounding area
